## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Revised the CRAN status badge hyperlink to the official CRAN package page

## Comments
This is a new package submission. The package provides the BID (Behavior Insight Design) framework for integrating behavioral science concepts into Shiny UI/UX design.
