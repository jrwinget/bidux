# Introduction to the BID Framework

## Introduction

The Behavioral Insight Design (BID) framework guides developers in
integrating behavioral science into UI/UX design. It helps in
understanding behavioral tendencies, psychological principles, and
common biases that affect user interactions.

The five stages of the BID framework are: 1. **Interpret the User’s
Need**: Clarify the core question and build a data narrative. 2.
**Notice the Problem**: Identify friction points and areas of high
cognitive load. 3. **Anticipate User Behavior**: Mitigate biases such as
anchoring and framing. 4. **Structure the Dashboard**: Organize layout
and design to enhance usability. 5. **Validate & Empower the User**:
Summarize insights and facilitate collaborative decision-making.

This vignette introduces the core ideas behind each stage and how they
interact to create effective, bias-aware dashboards.
