# Getting Started with bidux

This vignette provides a quick guide on how to use the **bidux** package to document and guide your Shiny app design process using the BID framework.

## Example Workflow

```r
library(bidux)

# Stage 1: Notice the Problem
notice <- bid_notice(
  problem = "Users find the interface cluttered and hard to navigate",
  theory = "Cognitive Load Theory",
  evidence = "User tests showed increased time to locate key features"
)

# Stage 2: Interpret the User's Need
interpret <- bid_interpret(
  previous_stage = notice,
  central_question = "How can we improve navigation clarity?",
  data_story = list(
    hook = "Interface overload",
    context = "Too many options on screen",
    tension = "User frustration",
    resolution = "Simplify and group related elements"
  )
)

# Stage 3: Structure the Dashboard
structure <- bid_structure(
  previous_stage = interpret,
  layout = "dual_process",
  concepts = c("principle_of_proximity", "default_effect")
)

# Stage 4: Anticipate User Behavior
anticipate <- bid_anticipate(
  previous_stage = structure,
  bias_mitigations = list(
    anchoring = "Use baseline comparisons",
    framing = "Present data with positive framing"
  )
)

# Stage 5: Validate & Empower the User
validate <- bid_validate(
  previous_stage = anticipate,
  summary_panel = "Key insights are summarized here",
  collaboration = "Annotations enabled for team feedback"
)
```
