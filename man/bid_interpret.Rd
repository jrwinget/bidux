\title{Document User Interpretation Stage in BID Framework}
\usage{
bid_interpret(
  previous_stage = NULL,
  central_question,
  data_story = NULL,
  user_personas = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{previous_stage}{Optional tibble or list output from an earlier BID
stage function. Since Interpret is the first stage in the BID
framework, this is typically NULL but can accept previous stage output
in some iteration scenarios.}

\item{central_question}{Required. A character string representing the main
question to be answered. If NULL, will be suggested based on previous
stage information.}

\item{data_story}{A list containing elements such as \code{hook},
\code{context}, \code{tension}, \code{resolution}, and optionally
\code{audience}, \code{metrics}, and \code{visual_approach}. If NULL,
elements will be suggested based on previous stage.}

\item{user_personas}{Optional list of user personas to consider in the
design.}
}
\value{
A tibble containing the documented information for the "Interpret"
stage.
}
\description{
This function documents the interpretation of user needs, capturing the
central question and the data storytelling narrative. It represents stage 1
in the BID framework.

# Basic usage
interpret_result <- bid_interpret(

    hook = "Declining trend in engagement",
    context = "Previous high engagement levels",
    tension = "Unexpected drop",
    resolution = "Investigate new UI changes"

)

# With user personas
interpret_personas <- bid_interpret(
  central_question = "How can we improve data discovery?",
  data_story = list(
    hook = "Users are missing key insights",
    context = "Critical data is available but overlooked",
    tension = "Time-sensitive decisions are delayed",
    resolution = "Highlight key metrics more effectively"
  ),
  user_personas = list(
    list(
      name = "Sara, Data Analyst",
      goals = "Needs to quickly find patterns in data",
      pain_points = "Gets overwhelmed by too many visualizations",
      technical_level = "Advanced"
    ),
    list(
      name = "Marcus, Executive",
      goals = "Wants high-level insights at a glance",
      pain_points = "Limited time to analyze detailed reports",
      technical_level = "Basic"
