\title{Document User Interpretation Stage in BID Framework}
\usage{
bid_interpret(
  previous_stage = NULL,
  central_question = NULL,
  data_story = NULL,
  user_personas = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{previous_stage}{Optional tibble or list output from an earlier BID stage
function. Since Interpret is now the first stage in the BID framework
(v0.3.0+), this is typically NULL but can accept previous stage output
in some iteration scenarios.}

\item{central_question}{A character string representing the main question to
be answered. If NULL, will be suggested based on previous stage
information.}

\item{data_story}{A list containing elements such as \code{hook},
\code{context}, \code{tension}, \code{resolution}, and optionally
\code{audience}, \code{metrics}, and \code{visual_approach}. If NULL,
elements will be suggested based on previous stage.}

\item{user_personas}{Optional list of user personas to consider in the
design.}
}
\value{
A tibble containing the documented information for the "Interpret"
stage.
}
\description{
This function documents the interpretation of user needs, capturing the
central question and the data storytelling narrative. It represents stage 1
in the BID framework.

# Let the function suggest content based on previous stage

# With user personas
