\usage{
bid_notice(problem, theory = NULL, evidence = NULL, target_audience = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{problem}{A character string describing the observed user problem.}

\item{theory}{A character string describing the behavioral theory that might
explain the problem. If NULL, will be auto-suggested using external
theory mappings.}

\item{evidence}{A character string describing evidence supporting the
problem.}

\item{target_audience}{Optional character string describing the target

}
\value{

stage. It represents stage 1 in the BID framework and now returns a
structured bid_stage object with enhanced metadata and external mapping
support.

\examples{
# Basic usage with auto-suggested theory
notice_result <- bid_notice(
  problem = "Users struggling with complex dropdowns and too many options",
  evidence = "User testing shows 65\% abandonment rate on filter selection"
)

# Print shows human-friendly summary
print(notice_result)

# Access underlying data
summary(notice_result)

# Check stage and metadata
get_stage(notice_result)
get_metadata(notice_result)

# With explicit theory
notice_explicit <- bid_notice(
  problem = "Mobile interface is difficult to navigate",
  theory = "Fitts's Law",
  evidence = "Mobile users report frustration with small touch targets",
  target_audience = "Mobile users with varying technical expertise"
)
