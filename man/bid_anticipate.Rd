\title{Document User Behavior Anticipation Stage in BID Framework}
\usage{
bid_anticipate(
  previous_stage,
  bias_mitigations = NULL,
  include_accessibility = TRUE,
  quiet = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{previous_stage}{A tibble or list output from an earlier BID stage
function.}

\item{bias_mitigations}{A named list of bias mitigation strategies. If NULL,
the function will suggest bias mitigations based on information from
previous stages.}

\item{include_accessibility}{Logical indicating whether to include
accessibility mitigations. Default is TRUE.}

\item{quiet}{Logical indicating whether to suppress informational messages.
If NULL, uses getOption("bidux.quiet", FALSE).}

\item{...}{Additional parameters. If 'interaction_principles' is provided,
it will be ignored with a warning.}
}
\value{
A tibble containing the documented information for the "Anticipate"
stage.
}
\description{
This function documents the anticipated user behavior by listing bias
mitigation strategies related to anchoring, framing, confirmation bias, etc.
It also supports adding interaction hints and visual feedback elements.
