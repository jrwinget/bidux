\title{Document User Behavior Anticipation Stage in BID Framework}
\usage{
bid_anticipate(previous_stage, bias_mitigations, interaction_principles = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{previous_stage}{A tibble or list output from \code{bid_structure()}.}

\item{bias_mitigations}{A named list of bias mitigation strategies.}

\item{interaction_principles}{A named list of interaction principles
(optional).}
}
\value{
A tibble containing the documented information for the "Anticipate"
stage.
}
\description{
This function documents the anticipated user behavior by listing bias
mitigation strategies related to anchoring, framing, confirmation bias, etc.
It also supports adding interaction hints and visual feedback elements.
