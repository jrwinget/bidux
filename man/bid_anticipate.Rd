\title{Document User Behavior Anticipation Stage in BID Framework}
\usage{
bid_anticipate(
  previous_stage,
  bias_mitigations = NULL,
  interaction_principles = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{previous_stage}{A tibble or list output from an earlier BID stage
function.}

\item{bias_mitigations}{A named list of bias mitigation strategies. If NULL,
the function will suggest bias mitigations based on information from
previous stages.}

\item{interaction_principles}{A named list of interaction principles
(optional).}
}
\value{
A tibble containing the documented information for the "Anticipate"
stage.
}
\description{
This function documents the anticipated user behavior by listing bias
mitigation strategies related to anchoring, framing, confirmation bias, etc.
It also supports adding interaction hints and visual feedback elements.

# Let the function suggest bias mitigations based on previous stages

# With interaction principles
