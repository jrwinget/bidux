\arguments{
\item{previous_stage}{A tibble output from an earlier BID stage function.}

\item{bias_mitigations}{A list of bias types and their mitigation strategies.}

\item{interaction_principles}{Optional character string describing interaction principles.}
}
\value{
A tibble containing the documented information for the "Anticipate"
stage.

A tibble containing the documented information for the "Anticipate" stage.
}
\description{
This function documents the anticipated user behavior by listing bias
mitigation strategies related to anchoring, framing, confirmation bias, etc.
It also supports adding interaction hints and visual feedback elements.

This function documents the anticipation stage, where cognitive biases and
user behavior patterns are considered and mitigated. It represents stage 4
in the BID framework.
