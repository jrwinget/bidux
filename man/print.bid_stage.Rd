}
\value{
Returns the input \code{bid_stage} object invisibly (class:
\code{c("bid_stage", "tbl_df", "tbl", "data.frame")}). The method is
called for its side effects: printing a formatted summary of the BID
stage to the console, including stage progress, key stage-specific
information, and usage suggestions. The invisible return allows for
method chaining while maintaining the primary purpose of console
output.
