\item{...}{Additional arguments}
}
\value{
Returns the input \code{bid_result} object invisibly (class:
\code{c("bid_result", "list")}). The method is called for its side
effects: printing a workflow overview to the console showing
completion status, stage progression, and key information from each
completed BID stage. The invisible return supports method chaining
while emphasizing the console summary output.
