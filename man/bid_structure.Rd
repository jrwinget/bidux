\examples{
interpret <- bid_notice(
  problem = "Users struggle with information overload",
  evidence = "Survey results indicate delays"
) |>
  bid_interpret(
    central_question = "How can we simplify data presentation?",

# Basic usage
bid_structure(
  previous_stage = interpret,
  layout = "dual_process",
  concepts = c("principle_of_proximity", "default_effect")
)

# With accessibility considerations
bid_structure(
  previous_stage = interpret,
  layout = "dual_process",
  concepts = c("principle_of_proximity", "default_effect"),
  accessibility = list(
    color_contrast = "Using WCAG AA-compliant color contrasts",
