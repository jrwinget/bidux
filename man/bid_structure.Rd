\title{Document Dashboard Structure Stage in BID Framework}
\usage{
bid_structure(previous_stage, layout, concepts = NULL, accessibility = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{previous_stage}{A tibble or list output from an earlier BID stage
function.}

\item{layout}{A character string indicating the layout type (e.g.,
"dual_process", "grid", "card", "tabs", "breathable").}

\item{concepts}{A character vector of BID concepts applied in this stage.
Concepts can be provided in natural language (e.g., "Principle of
Proximity") or with underscores (e.g., "principle_of_proximity"). The
function uses fuzzy matching to identify the concepts. If NULL, will
attempt to detect relevant concepts from previous stages.}

\item{accessibility}{A list of accessibility considerations (optional).
Common parameters include: color_contrast, keyboard_navigation,
screen_reader, text_size, alternative_text, focus_indicators,
semantic_markup, and aria_labels.}
}
\value{
A tibble containing the documented information for the "Structure"
stage.
}
\description{
This function documents the structure of the dashboard, including layout and
design elements such as proximity, dual-processing, and default effects.
It supports modern layout approaches like breathable layouts and visual
hierarchies, while ensuring accessibility considerations are properly
documented.
