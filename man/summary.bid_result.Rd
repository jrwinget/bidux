\usage{
\method{summary}{bid_result}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A bid_result object}

\item{...}{Additional arguments}
}
\value{
Returns the input \code{bid_result} object invisibly (class:
\code{c("bid_result", "list")}). The method is called for its side
effects: printing a detailed workflow analysis to the console
including completion statistics, duration metrics, and comprehensive
stage-by-stage breakdowns with key data from each BID framework
stage. The invisible return facilitates method chaining while
focusing on comprehensive console reporting.
