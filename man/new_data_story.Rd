\value{
A bid_data_story S3 object
}
\description{
Creates a structured data story object for use in bid_interpret() and other
bidux functions. The flattened API (hook, context, tension, resolution) is
recommended for most users. The nested format (variables, relationships) is
still supported for backward compatibility.
}
\examples{
# Recommended: flat API
story <- new_data_story(
  hook = "User engagement is declining",
  context = "Our dashboard usage has dropped 30\% this quarter",
  tension = "We don't know if it's UX issues or changing user needs",
  resolution = "Analyze telemetry to identify friction points"
)

# With optional fields
story_detailed <- new_data_story(
  hook = "Revenue dashboards are underutilized",
  context = "Only 40\% of sales team uses the new revenue dashboard",
  tension = "Critical metrics are being missed",
  resolution = "Redesign with behavioral science principles",
  audience = "Sales team",
  metrics = "adoption_rate, time_to_insight"
)
